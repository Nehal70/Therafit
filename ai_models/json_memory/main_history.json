You later mentioned that your legs were hurting, so I asked about any recent or previous injuries to better tailor the recommendations.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the next step for your recovery. Given your history and current situation, here's a recommended exercise:\n\n**Exercise:** Seated Leg Extension  \n**Description:** Sit on a chair with your back straight and feet flat on the floor.
