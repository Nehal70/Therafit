You're currently dealing with knee pain, and we've been focusing on exercises that are gentle on the knees. Let's continue with another exercise to support your recovery:\n\n**Exercise:** Ankle Circles  \n**Description:** Sit comfortably in a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Lift one foot slightly off the ground and slowly rotate your ankle in a circular motion. Complete a set of rotations in one direction, then switch directions. This exercise helps improve ankle flexibility and can support knee stability by enhancing the range of motion in the lower leg.  \n**Duration:** 5 minutes (alternating ankles)\n\nOnce you've completed this exercise, let me know how it felt, and we can proceed with the next steps.",
