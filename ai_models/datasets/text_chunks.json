It can be performed for time or reps as part of the ab-focused portion of any workout. | Strength | Abdominals | Bands | Intermediate",
    "5 | Decline band press sit-up | The decline band press sit-up is a weighted core exercise that works the rectus abdominis or \"six pack\" muscles, as well as the deep core muscles.

    "28 | Two-way swing | The two-way kettlebell swing is an exercise that alternates a chest-height kettlebell swing (sometimes called a \"Russian\" or \"hardstyle\" swing) with an overhead kettlebell swing (sometimes called an \"American\" swing). Both swing variations work many of the same muscles, such as the hamstrings, glutes, and core, but because the weight must travel farther in the overhead swing, it's slightly more metabolically demanding and works the upper back and shoulders more. This combo can be performed for time or reps and works especially well in circuit-style or full-body training. If you can't perform the overhead swing without lower back or shoulder pain, just perform the chest-height swing. | Strength | Abdominals | Kettlebells | Intermediate",
    "29 | Kettlebell crab reach | The kettlebell crab reach is a kettlebell pressing exercise in which the lifter presses a kettlebell overhead while in a modified single-arm bridge position.

    "1517 | Negative pull-up | The negative pull-up is a multijoint bodyweight exercise that focuses on just one half of the traditional pull-up: the lowering, eccentric, or \"negative\" portion. Because muscles are stronger eccentrically than they are concentrically, many people can perform negatives even if they can't perform full pull-ups.

    "1937 | Single-leg dumbbell Romanian deadlift | The single-leg dumbbell Romanian deadlift is a movement targeting the muscles of the hamstrings, glutes, and back. The difference between a Romanian deadlift and a stiff-legged deadlift is the amount of knee bend. The knees are only slightly bent in a stiff-legged deadlift, while they bend more in a Romanian deadlift. Single-leg deadlifts are generally performed for low to moderate reps, such as 8-10 reps per set, with a focus on maximizing the hamstring stretch rather than moving heavy weight. If balance is a challenge, this movement is still very effective if performed while holding on to a stable object for support. | Strength | Quadriceps | Dumbbell | Intermediate",

The bar is held with a parallel (palms in) grip outside of the legs. It is biomechanically different from a barbell deadlift in that it lines up with a lifter's center of gravity, rather than placing the weight in front of their body. It activates all of the same muscle groups as conventional or sumo deadlifts, including the glutes, quads, hamstrings, lower back, lats, upper back, and grip. | Strength | Quadriceps | Other | Intermediate | 8.8 | Average",

    "2529 | Standing dumbbell shoulder press | The standing dumbbell shoulder press is a classic deltoid-building exercise that is common in gyms around the world. Performing the move standing up as opposed to seated allows more weight to be used and taxes the core more than seated presses. The standing press is worthy of being the main movement in a muscle-building shoulder workout, but is also a great strength movement and accessory for the bench press. | Strength | Shoulders | Dumbbell | Intermediate | 9.1 | Average",
    "2530 | Single-arm lateral raise | The single-arm lateral raise is a shoulder exercise that targets the medial or middle head of the deltoid muscle.

    "2535 | Alternating standing shoulder press | The alternating standing shoulder press is a popular dumbbell exercise targeting the shoulders. It can be performed in strength-focused rep ranges, such as 5-8 reps per set, or for higher reps to build muscle or for conditioning. | Strength | Shoulders | Dumbbell | Intermediate | 9.0 | Average",
    "2536 | Single-arm incline rear delt raise | The single-arm incline rear delt raise is an upper-body exercise targeting the posterior deltoids or shoulder muscles, as well as the postural muscles of the upper back. Training each side independently can help correct imbalances in size, strength, and shoulder stability. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more. | Strength | Shoulders | Dumbbell | Intermediate | 9.0 | Average",
    "2537 | Alternating dumbbell front raise | The alternating dumbbell front raise is a single-joint exercise targeting the shoulder muscles, particularly the front or anterior deltoids.

    "2539 | Single-dumbbell front raise | The single-dumbbell front raise is an isolation movement that targets the shoulders. In particular, it focuses on the anterior or front head of the deltoid muscles. By performing it with one dumbbell at a time, you can focus on each shoulder muscle independently and try to address muscular imbalances between shoulders. This movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body or shoulder-focused workout. | Strength | Shoulders | Dumbbell | Intermediate | 9.0 | Average",

    "2543 | Bent-over dumbbell rear delt row | The bent-over dumbbell rear delt row is a popular upper-body exercise that targets the muscles on the backside of the shoulder joint, specifically the medial and rear heads of the deltoid. Since pressing movements build the front and (to a lesser degree) side deltoid heads, this move is often done to promote balanced shoulder development. It is usually performed for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more, as part of a shoulder or upper-body workout. | Strength | Shoulders | Dumbbell | Intermediate | 8.7 | Average",
    "2544 | Incline dumbbell front raise | The incline dumbbell front raise is an upper-body exercise targeting the shoulders. Because it is performed face down on an angled bench, it has a greater range of motion than standing or upright-seated raises and hits the shoulders from a different angle.

    "2547 | Single-arm incline lateral raise | The single-arm incline lateral raise is an exercise targeting the lateral or medial head of the shoulder muscles. It is performed lying sideways on an incline bench set to around 45 degrees, which helps to increase the range of motion in the lift and enforce strict form. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more. | Strength | Shoulders | Dumbbell | Intermediate | 8.5 | Average",
    "2548 | Seated rear delt fly | The seated rear delt fly is an upper-body exercise that targets the real deltoid of the shoulder.

    "2560 | Single-arm half-kneeling shoulder press | The single-arm half-kneeling shoulder press is a popular exercise to target the deltoid muscles while also developing strength and stability in the core and hips. Balance can be a challenge, which is one reason why this movement is generally trained lighter than standing single-arm shoulder presses. The half-kneeling press can be used as an accessory lift for the shoulder press or bench press, or simply as a technique to make shoulder presses stricter and more athletic. | Strength | Shoulders | Dumbbell | Intermediate | 0.0 | Average",

    "2562 | Dumbbell shoulder press with body rotation | The dumbbell shoulder press with body rotation is a twist on the traditional dumbbell shoulder press. Rather than pressing straight overhead, you twist your torso and hips to the side during each rep. It hits the deltoid muscles just like a shoulder press, but adds a challenge to the core, hips, and back muscles. Due to the potential balance challenge of twisting and pressing at the same time, it is commonly performed with light to moderate weights. | Strength | Shoulders | Dumbbell | Intermediate",
